#  All decisions are depends on a condition being met  . If ....esle

# 1. if - elif statement.
age = 45                            # Define a value of age      
if (age > 40):                      # Condition 1
    print("40 is less than 45")
elif(age > 40 ):                    # Condition 2
    print("45 is greater than 40")
else:                               # Condition 3
    print("45 is not equal to 40")

print("Done !")

# This conditional expression check only one correct statement and print the output.
#  and indentation is very important.(4 space or 1 tab).

# 2. Multiple statement
a =  20               # Define a value of a 

if (a<30):            # Multiple conditions and multiple outputs
    print("30 is greater than 20")

if(a>10):
    print("10 is less than 20")

if(a==20):
    print("a is equal to 20")
