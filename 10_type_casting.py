# Type casting is a way to convert one data type to another. ( String to Integer / interger to sting if possible )

# For string to integer
a = "2003" # this is not a integer because it is written in "..."

# print(type(a))    ---> if you want to check class of a then use first code.
a =  int(a) #this convert string --> integer
print(a + 5) 

# For Integer to String
b = 2022 # this is a integer
b = str(b) # this convert integer ---> sring
print( "Present year is",b) #this represent a integer as a string and we can not get any error. 
print("500",b)
